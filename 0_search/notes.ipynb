    "\n",
    "#### We have an __evironment__ and want our (intelligent) __agent__ to look for a __solution__\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terminology:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Agent \n",
    "\n",
    "Entity that perceives its environment and acts upon that environment\n",
    "\n",
    "#### State \n",
    "\n",
    "Configuration of the agent and the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initial State\n",
    "\n",
    "The state where the agent begins\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "Choices that can be made in any given state\n",
    "\n",
    "Defined as a function: $Actions(s)$ returns the set of actions that can be applied at state $s$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transition Model\n",
    "\n",
    "A description of what state we get when we perform some action in a given state\n",
    "\n",
    "Defined as a function: $Result(s, a)$ returns the resulting state of performing action $a$ at state $s$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### State Space\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of all reachable states from the initial state by _any_ (0, 1, 2 ... n) sequence of actions\n",
    "\n",
    "This is usually represented _as a graph_\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Goal Test\n",
    "\n",
    "Way to determine if a state is the goal state, where the program ends\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Path Cost\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Not only finding a goal state, but finding it well, with a low cost\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A numerical cost associated with a given path (action)\n",
    "\n",
    "Weights associated with the _edges_ of the graph\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "A sequence of __actions__ that leads from the __initial state__ to the __goal state__ (a state that passes the __goal test__)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optimal Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The __solution__ with the lowest __path cost__\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Node\n",
    "\n",
    "An auxiliary data structure for running search programs\n",
    "\n",
    "Contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a state\n",
    "- a parent node\n",
    "- an action (applied from parent node to reach this node)\n",
    "- a path cost (from the initial state to this node. cumulative)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Frontier\n",
    "\n",
    "Data structure that contains all possible (and unexplored) nodes. Starts with a single node, the __initial state__.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Search Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "* Start with the frontier with the __initial state__\n",
    "* Start with empty __explored set__\n",
    "\n",
    "* Repeat:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * If the frontier is empty, report that there's no solution\n",
    "    * Pick a node and remove it from the frontier (choosing a node from the frontier is an important part of the algorithm)\n",
    "    * If the node is a __goal state__ report the solution with its path\n",
    "    * Add the node to the __explored set__\n",
    "    * If the note is not a __goal state__, _expand_ the node, add resulting nodes to the frontier if they're not in the frontier or the __explored set__\n",
    "\n",
    "__Note:__ Once we explore a state, we __don't go back to it__ (this is in order to avoid loops)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Picking Next Node: Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "If we use a stack (LIFO), our search becomes __DFS__.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we use a queue (FIFO), our search becomes __BFS__.\n",
    "\n",
    "DFS will always find a solution (if search space is finite) but no necessarily the __optimal solution__ \n",
    "\n",
    "BFS will always find an __optimal solution__ (if search space is finite) but exploring a big piece of the search space (slow)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improving on DFS and BFS\n",
    "\n",
    "DFS will find a solution, but perhaps not the optimal one. On the other hand, BFS will find the optimal solution but it may take too long. Can we improve with _human intuition_ on these algorithms?\n",
    "\n",
    "One option would be, in problems like 2D mazes, to move always towards the __solution state__ coordinates For example, if the current state is `[4, 4]` and the solution is `[10, 10]`, given two $Action(s)$ one that goes up and one that goes down, __pick the former__.\n",
    "\n",
    "This distinction creates 2 new types of algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- uninformed: uses __no__ problem specific knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "- informed: uses problem specific knowledge to find solutions _more efficiently_\n",
    "\n",
    "### Greedy Best-First Search\n",
    "\n",
    "A kind of _informed search_ alogirthm, expands the node _closer_ to the __solution state__, determined by an _heuristic_ (estimation) function $h(n)$ where $n$ is a given state.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that we don't __know__ which state is closer to the goal for sure (if that would be the case, there would be no search at all, just follow the next state), the _heuristic_ is an estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a 2D maze a simple heuristic would be the [Manhattan Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry)\n",
    "\n",
    "It's called _greedy_ because it makes the best decision _locally_ or _immediately_. This may cause the algorithm to take an initial good looking path that would end in a __non-optimal solution__.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to fix this is taking into account not only the estimated __path cost__ of the next state, but the whole cost of the path that took us to the current state.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### A* Search\n",
    "\n",
    "A search algorithm that expands the node with lowest value $g(n) + h(n)$, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $h(n)$ is our heuristic function (same as in greedy bfs)\n",
    "* $g(n)$ is the cost of having reached the current state \n",
    "\n",
    "Does A* find the __optimal solution__? Yes but:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $h(n)$ must be _admissible_: never overestimate the cost (but it can underestimate)\n",
    "* $h(n)$ must be _consistent_: for every node $n$ and successor $n'$ with a cost of $c$ to make that transition, $h(n) \\le h(n') + c$\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of A* depends on choosing a good $h(n)$ function"
